A simple script to install neovim from the offical AppImage.

# Install

curl --proto '=https' -sSfL https://github.com/geoffritter/neovim-install-appimage/releases/latest/download/neovim-install-appimage.sh | bash

# Why make this?

I wanted to make a bash script to do something once and was frustrated by there being no 'verified' flatpak on flathub. AppImage also needs more love.
